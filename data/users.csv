<p>I'm a New Zealander, and I speak and write in New Zealand English.</p>

<p>If you'd like to edit my posts for spelling, please verify whether my spelling is correct in New Zealand; if so, I will likely revert your spelling ""fix"".</p>

<p>In particular, in New Zealand, we use:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>-ise</em> (e.g., optimise) and <em>-yse</em> (e.g., analyse) instead of <em>-ize</em> or <em>-yze</em></li>
<li>enrol, distil, and instil (with one <em>l</em>), and likewise enrolment and instalment (but install)</li>
<li>colour, humour, glamour, and labour (with a <em>u</em>) when on its own, but without a <em>u</em> in some compound forms (humorous, glamorous, and laborious, but colourful)</li>
<li><em>-t</em> forms for the past tenses of some verbs, such as dreamt, learnt, leant, and spelt, much akin to slept, meant, lent, and spent</li>
<li>manoeuvre, oestrogen, oesophagus, aesthetics, encyclopaedia, paediatrics, etc., where US English would use <em>e-</em> instead of <em>ae-</em> or <em>oe-</em></li>
<li>offence, defence, licence, practice (when used as noun); license, practise (when used as verb)</li>
<li>manoeuvre, centre, metre, litre, mitre, etc., where US English would use <em>-er</em> instead of <em>-re</em></li>
<li>Macca's, where US English would use Mickey D's ;-)</li>
</ul>

<p>This list is not exhaustive. :-)</p>

<p>(This does not in any way contradict the site policy of licensing everything under CC-Wiki; it simply gives users even more freedom. In particular, you are not obliged to link back to SO when you use my code snippets.)</p>

<p>I'm a Java developer with exposure to several other languages and platforms including .Net, Ruby/Rails, and Flex.</p>

<p>I've worked on a variety of types of projects ranging from short term individual work to very large scale, multi-phase projects using multiple large development teams.</p>

<p>I've developed both back end message processing systems as well as end user facing webapps.</p>

<br/><br/>
I am one of those guys that wanted to make those Atari and Commodore computers on display in K-Mart in the early 80's do something.  I spent way too much time in the 7-11's (and any other arcade) blowing my allowance on Donkey Kong, Galaga and the rest.<br/><br/>That and countless hours playing Zork on my aforementioned Commodore 64 got me hooked on programming, always with a desire to animate things and make really cool graphical stuff.  Somehow I ended up doing factory automation software, enterprise apps and web site integration to legacy back ends.  The closest I get to games is doing XHTML/CSS and pretending I'm a designer.

Going on 10 years (2016).  We mostly use c#/.Net and JavaScript to build our application.  Dabble in windows administration - just enough to be dangerous - setting up virtual environments for development in Virtual Box and then Hyper-V.  Just enough installation experience to, again, be dangerous... mostly using WiX Toolset, though recently used Wise community with VS2015.  Challenges are keeping up with a rapidly changing UI from Microsoft and regularly changing APIs (something is deprecated and replaced about every 3 years) on both the client and server side.  Hoping to see it stabilize around WebAPI.  For reporting, Dynamics provides an extremely challenging database design where the only access goes through views built w/ UDFs in their joins.  It makes SSRS development challenging but fun, with ridiculous execution plans.</p>

Working in Java as a hobby, still, and it's not as bad on me as it used to be, I quite like some of the things introduced in Java 7. I enjoy working in JS very much every time I get a chance, but I am very very sceptical of most popular JS frameworks. I seem to be too old already for AngularJS.</p>

<p>Things that make my professional life a happier one include Joda Time, and Guava. Also, git and JIRA, and JSON, and Postgres (reading the release notes for 9.4 made my day), and UTF-8. And coffee.</p>

My name is Fernando Rueda.
I am a native of El Paso, Texas.
I have been programming as a hobby since I was in elementary school.
I worked as an electronic technician for many years while working on my bachelors degree.
Some of the companies I worked for include the United States Air Force and Intel.
I graduated from the University of New Mexico with a degree in Computer Science in 2006.
Not long after graduating, I went to work for the Navy's weapons development lab in the Californian high desert.
However, I decided not to pursue that career path and I returned to El Paso.
Since I have always had the ambition of working for myself, I have started this software company.
I hope to develop applications for the G-Phone at first since I already have all the tools.
In the future I hope to create applications for the I-Phone.

<p>I've been moving towards the web side of things, so JQuery, LESS etc are becoming increasingly important.</p>

<ul>
<li>RavenDB (Document DB)</li>
<li>Neo4j (Graph DB)</li>
</ul>

<p>And Neo4j is winning in being one of the nicest DB's I've <em>ever</em> worked with. I've dealt with RDBMS databases (SQL Server, MySQL), but I wouldn't class myself as a DBA :)</p>

<p>I'm learning F# and Haskell (slowly), but at the moment I am mostly a C# developer (which I have to say I thoroughly enjoy).</p>

<p>Personally - I waveski (whaaaat? <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wOCsSFm6-c"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Waveskiing"">Video here</a>) and run competitions in the UK (via <a href=""http://www.tournr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Tournr</a>), I also do the traditional things of reading, eating, breathing, but we all know that... and I've just taken up (after a 20 year hiatus) the Piano.</p>

<p>Usage note 
2.  A traditional rule governing the case of personal pronouns after forms of the verb to be  is that the nominative or subjective form ( I; she; he; we; they ) must be chosen. Some 400 years ago, owing to the feeling that the postverb position in a sentence is object rather than subject territory, me  and other objective pronouns ( him; her; us; them ) began to replace the subjective forms after be,  so that It is I  became It is me.</p>

</p>

<p>
In addition to my current role (and hands-on software developer), I've been an analyst, project manager, DBA, and team lead for previous employers.</p>

<p>In general I want to build great software, but not necessarily all by myself.</p>

<p>My strengths:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eye for detail and finish, perseverance and passion to learn</li>
<li>As a software architect: API, protocol and data-model design,
                        focus on testability and incremental evolution, documentation,
                        explaining complex things in simple terms</li>
<li>As a software engineer: Java, C#, C, Python, parsers (Bison/YACC, ANTLR), 
                       regexes, build tools (MSBuild, Ant, Make)</li>
<li>As a manager: strategic vision, planning and pragmatism, empathy &amp; humility, clear communication</li>
</ul>

<p>My weaknesses:</p>

<ul>
<li>Slow starter, lots of context needed/wanted</li>
<li>As a software architect: ?</li>
<li>As a software engineer: UI design</li>
<li>As a manager: no interest in micro-management, office politics, long emails</li>

I'm also into physics and astronomy, <a href=""http://last.fm/user/mattkantor"" rel=""nofollow"">music</a>, sociology, philosophy, and just about anything that I think might help me make sense of this crazy and beautiful world. Designing things and solving problems are ways of channeling my creative energy to shape a better future.</p>

<p>I grew up on <a href=""http://schocharieridge.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">a rural horse farm</a> in New Tripoli, PA. There still isn't cable on our street, the phone lines were so bad that we were lucky to get a 30K internet connection, and it took 45 minutes to traverse my old school district. We once found moonshine under our floorboards when remodeling a room.</p>

<p>I like fixing things; I enjoy the outdoors; I think that most people take themselves way too seriously. I derive a profound sense of spiritual fulfillment—though I'm not a religious man—from exploring the whys and whats of this world.</p>

<hr>

<p>Most of my professional career has involved web design &amp; development.</p>

<p>I enjoy building modular software with clean yet flexible APIs. When creating web services, I believe in building atop HTTP instead of kludging my way around it: I create RESTful systems that are truly part of the web in both spirit and practice.</p>

<p>I try to use open source software and follow open standards whenever practical.</p>

<p>At work, I'm developing in PHP, MySQL, Javascript, HTML.
I use Ubuntu, Apache, Eclipse, Subversion...</p>

<p>At the moment I'm interested in object-oriented design and development, and I'm constantly trying to improve my skills in this field.</p>

<p>I'm also interested in getting ""old"" projects out of their rotting state: refactoring, and dealing with legacy code. Unfortunately, we don't have much time to do this at work right now.</p>

<p>At home, when I have some spare time, I also like programming. I tried some Nintendo DS programming in Lua, C, and C++. In the process, I learned (basic) OpenGL and wxWidgets on desktop computers, too. I also used Git, GitHub, and Google Project Hosting for personal projects.</p>

<p>Besides programming and computers, I'm a total music (metal/rock) and movie (fantasy/horror/sci-fi) geek. I like going to live gigs, eating in nice restaurants, and travelling to countries I never visited before.</p>

I'm a Delphi and C# developer, going back to Turbo Pascal 5.5, TPW and BP/O7. Currently working with Xamarin, Winforms and some WPF. I do a reasonable amount of SQL Server (mostly schema design, sprocs and T-SQL utilities) and maintain some legacy apps that use Firebird, Interbase and MySQL.<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I develop bespoke software - I run my <a href=""http://www.robsoft.net"" rel=""nofollow"">own small company</a>, mostly writing point-of-sale systems for the financial services and high-street finance type markets.<br>&nbsp;<br>
In my downtime I explore my Mac (I switched a few years ago, now I do all my work in VMs on the Mac), and I have a 4-year-old daughter who is the other 'apple of my eye'.<br>&nbsp;<br></p>

I'm making a note here:
HUGE SUCCESS.
It's hard to overstate
my satisfaction.
Aperture Science
We do what we must
because we can.
For the good of all of us.
Except the ones who are dead.
But there's no sense crying
over every mistake.
You just keep on trying
till you run out of cake.
And the Science gets done.
And you make a neat gun.
For the people who are
still alive.


I'm not even angry.
I'm being so sincere right now.
Even though you broke my heart.
And killed me.
And tore me to pieces.
And threw every piece into a fire.
As they burned it hurt because
I was so happy for you!
Now these points of data
make a beautiful line.
And we're out of beta.
We're releasing on time.
So I'm GLaD. I got burned.
Think of all the things we learned
for the people who are
still alive.

Go ahead and leave me.
I think i prefer to stay inside.
maybe you'll find someone else
to help you.
maybe Black Mesa...
THAT WAS A JOKE, HA HA, FAT CHANCE.
Anyway this cake is great.
It's so delicious and moist
look at me still talking when theres science to do
when i look out there
it makes me glad I'm not you
i've experiments to run
there is research to be done
on the people who are
still alive.


and believe me I am still alive
I'm doing science and I'm still alive
i feel fantastic and I'm still alive
while your dying ill be still alive
and when your dead i will be still alive
still alive
still alive","374","635","18","","","35","2976"

<p>As a kid, he wrote programs on a mechanical typewriter, imagining what the computer would do with his BASIC programs. In 1982, he bought his first 8-bit CPU (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCA_1802"" rel=""nofollow"">RCA 1802</a>) which he programmed in binary, by toggling switches.</p>

<p>In 1984, he discovered the <a href=""http://www.smaky.ch"" rel=""nofollow"">Smaky</a> at the local school and started experimenting with new programming languages, such as PASCAL, LOGO, PROLOG, etc.</p>

<p>On Christmas 1985 he received a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_128#Commodore_128D"" rel=""nofollow"">Commodore 128D</a> from his parents, on which he developed his first real applications: a drawing program, followed the next year by a text processor.</p>

<p>In 1991, he wrote his first implementation a LISP interpreter for the Smaky computer. He had already acquired some experience developing system software, applications and drivers in CALM assembly language for the Smaky OS.</p>

<p>A few years later, he gradually switched from assembly language to C++ and contributed a port of GCC and Ghostscript to the Smaky. He also developed the <a href=""http://infini.smaky.ch/"" rel=""nofollow"">Smaky emulator</a> and the last Smaky hardware (Smaky 400).</p>

<p>Now, he is still happy developing software, but mainly in C#...</p>

<p>Pierre has a Ph.D. in Computer Science (artificial intelligence) from the <a href=""http://www.epfl.ch"" rel=""nofollow"">EPFL</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Please obfuscate your code making it, at best, unobviously broken. Even if the code isn't important.</li>
<li>Global state has been a known bad idea for forty years. Please don't do it.</li>
<li>Corollary of either of the first two guidelines: Singletons are pure evil. Don't. </li>
<li>Please think about encapsulate. That implies not shoving getters and setters all over the place. Also prefer not use implementation inheritance and avoid protected. Generally limit unnecessary access and implied implementation, even on larger scales.</li>
<li>Please practice good dependency hygiene. Yeah it's not interesting, but turns out to be really important for a number of reasons.</li>
<li>If you're doing layers of security, please do check each layer individually. </li>
<li>Please don't give nulls a meaning. Throw an NPE.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Things that are wrong:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>""Postel's Law"". Good for UI, but for machine interface you wont catch errors and differences fixing mistakes allows TOCTOU-style vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow. Increasing the number of reviewers decreases the depth each one expends on the problem. It's the maximum depth which is crucial unless the problem is trivial in which case who cares.</li>
<li>Vulnerabilities are the adversary's fault. Vulnerabilities are the fault of the party that decided to ship the faulty product.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Work:</strong> A ""Vulnerability Engineer"" in the Java SE Security team for Oracle Corporation UK Ltd.</p>

<p><strong>Top advice:</strong> If I were you, I wouldn't be starting from here.</p>

<p><strong>Toast advice:</strong> Look after the corners and the middle will look after itself.</p>

Our high school math teacher asked us to write an application to check logical equations. I got back home and immediately started working on it. The problem was, I knew very little about programming. Although the application was quite simple it took me the whole night to get it right. Despite all the hours spent on the problem I was too excited to notice that I had no sleep.</p>

<p>I was hooked on programming and problem solving. This lasts to this day, although I wrote that first application some twenty years ago.</p>

<p>Back it wasn't easy to learn anything especially where I grew up. I didn't know any other programmers. There was no Internet to look up an answer and most definitely there was no StackOverflow.</p>

<p>Nowadays it's much easier to find necessary technical information. The hard problem is to design whole systems and how all the bits should fit together.</p>

<p>Even harder and at the same time more important task is to figure out what problem we are trying to solve with a given piece of software.</p>
